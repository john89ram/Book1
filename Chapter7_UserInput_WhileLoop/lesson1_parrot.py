# Working with the input() function. 
    # The input() function will pause the program and wait for the user to enter something
    # Then it will assign it to a variable to use at another time.

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

# Here the user input is connected to the "message" variable and then can be used to call when printing it
