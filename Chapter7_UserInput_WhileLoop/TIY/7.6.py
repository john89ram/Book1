# Three Exits - Write a different version of TIY 7.4 or 7.5 but include the following requirements:
    # Use a conditional test in a while statement to stop the loop
    # Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs
    # Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters 'quit'
