# Lets practice creating a simple function.

def greet_user():
    # Here the "def" tells Python that we are defining a function called "greet_user"
        # This is called a "function definition"
    """Display a simple greeting."""
    # ^ This is called a docstring, these describes the function
        # Docstring are created by using 3 quotations """docstring"""
    print("Hello!")
    # After the formalities you can write the code for your function. 
        # This can be any code you can write, this is just a simple "hello world" script.

greet_user()
# Now you can just call the function and Python will search for and run the function.
    # Because we did not need input here it will just print.
