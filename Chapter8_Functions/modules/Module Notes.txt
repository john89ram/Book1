Importing a module
import module_name.py
    (This will make all functions within this .py to used in your program)
    You can also import certain functions within the module without importing the whole with the from request.
from module_name import function_name
    or you can pull multiple functions from the same module
from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2
    when importing the function by name you would no longer need to call it by using the formal way.
    examples are showed below

Calling a function inside a module (formal)    
module_name.function_name()
    This is important to remember as modules might have a ton of functions within them.
    
Calling a function directly import from module
function_name()
