# Writing a simple if statement

age=17
if age>=18:
    print("You are old enough to vote!")
    print("Have you registered to vote yet?")
    # Now lets get a little more complicated and add an else statement to continue the problem when the conditional test fails
else:
    print("Sorry, you are too young to vote.")
    print("Please register to vote as soon as you turn 18!")
# This will print if the user is too less than the age of 18
