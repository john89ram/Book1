A dictionary in Python is a collection of 'key-value pairs'. 
This means that when creating dictionaries that the key must be created in 2s attached to its value.
    - The name of the 'key' (color, name, points, etc.)
    - And the 'value' itself (green, john, 5, etc.)

When you call a dictionary key it will spit out its value 
    - A key's value can contain a number, string, a list, or even another dictionary.
    *** Dictionaries can be override when creating new key-value pairs.
    
You can create a dictionary with these braces {} with key-value pairs inside.
    Dictionaries can hold limitless amount of key-value pairs.

Removing key-value pairs 
    To remove information inside a dictionary that is no longer needed you can delete (as a whole or by key).
    del alien_0['points']

alien_0 = {'color':'green'}

To grab the value associated with a key, you must give the name of the dictionary and then place the key inside of 
square brackets.
    print(alien_0['color'])
The dictionary ^     ^ and the key - this will call the value of the key for that dictionary

OUTPUT:
green
