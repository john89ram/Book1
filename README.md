# Book1

This is a journey of teaching myself how to program offically! 
I will make a serious attempt to deep dive into "Python Crash Course" and truely understand how to program.

So my personal goal is to at least give a couple of minutes a day to read and practice.
I have offically started on Aug 19th. 

Hopefully old dogs can learn new tricks.
Wish me luck!
